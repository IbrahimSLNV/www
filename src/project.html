            <h1>NAVIGATION DE NAYER</h1>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm <b>Ibrahim Selmanov</b>, first years student in
              Electronics-ICT @
              <a href="https://thomasmore.be/en/campus-de-nayer"
                >Thomas More Campus De Nayer</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              My project, made with two other students, is a website containing
              maps of Campus De Nayer. Users are able to dynamically navigate
              these maps and click on different locations to show their details.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#details">Details</a></li>
              <li><a href="#software">Software</a></li>
              <li><a href="#team">Team</a></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="details">
            <h1 id="details">DETAILS</h1>
            <hr />
            <div class="details-content">
              <video src="./assets/video/demonstration.mp4" controls></video>
              <div>
                <p>
                  When deciding on what to make, I thought that I needed to make
                  something that users could really use. That's when I thought:
                  when I first came to Campus De Nayer, I felt a bit lost... "if
                  only I had a tool that I could use to see where classrooms are
                  from home...", I said. And then came this idea. You can see
                  for yourself on the left how the website ended up looking. Now
                  making the website was a total different subject, I never had
                  actually worked on "real" websites before... how was I going
                  to achieve this? Well, this was possible thanks to Vue.JS!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'll explain in the <a href="#software">software</a> section
                  how this works.
                </p>

            <h1 id="software">SOFTWARE</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Due to issues with space, you can use the different buttons to
              navigate between each explanation of my code.

              <p>
                Vue.js is a JavaScript framework used to build websites and web
                apps. It helps you create interactive parts of a webpage more
                easily (like buttons that do things when you click them, or
                content that updates without reloading the page). Components in
                Vue (and even other frameworks) are like lego's. Think of them
                as reusable bits of code that represent parts of your webpage
                (like a navigation bar, a button, or a comment section). Each
                component has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it handles
                its own look and behavior. So with Vue, instead of writing one
                huge file for everything, you build your page out of these
                small, organized pieces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you may ask how I implemented Vue's components inside my
                project? Click on the ">" button.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main">
              <img src="./assets/img/screenshotCodeApp.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                Using the explanation from earlier, here I used three main
                components: Welcome.vue, Navigation.vue and RoomDetails.vue.
                Each of these components represents a different section of the
                website. The welcome component is a starting screen that appears
                when the page loads for the first time. The navigation component
                lets the user navigate our maps. And the RoomDetails component
                appears each time the users selects a room. Only one component
                is shown at a time, depending on which variables are true:
                showWelcome, showNavigation or showRoomDetails. To make
                navigating between each components smoother, I added transitions
                using the &lt;Transitions&gt; tag. This tag is pre-built in
                Vue.js and adds a visual effect.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="axios">
              <img src="./assets/img/screenshotAxios.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                Now this could be the most important piece of code inside my
                main file. The getRoomData(name) function is used to get
                information about a room when a user clicks on it. It sends a
                request to a server using Axios, asking for room data based on
                the name that was passed to the function. For example, if the
                name is "A0.04", the function tries to get data from
                http://localhost:5000/rooms/name/A004. If the server responds
                successfully, the data is saved into a variable called RoomData,
                and the view is updated: the welcome screen and navigation are
                hidden, and the RoomDetails component is shown to display the
                info.
              </p>
              <p>
                If something goes wrong (like the room doesn't exist or the
                server is offline) the function still shows the RoomDetails
                component, but fills it with “waiting” so that the user knows
                something is loading or missing. This helps the site continue
                working smoothly, even if there's a problem getting the real
                data.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram">
              <img src="./assets/img/diagram.png" alt="">
            </div> 
          </div>
          <div class="team">
            <h1 id="team">TEAM</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
              The team consists of me (Ibrahim Selmanov), Jappe De Coster and
              Bruno Almasi.
            </p>
            <p>
              While me and Bruno were working on the front-end, Jappe was
              working on the back-end. Thanks to Jappe and his good work on the
              back-end we were able to entirely focus on the front-end. This
              made sure that I could put all my efforts into desinging the
              website and its functionality.
